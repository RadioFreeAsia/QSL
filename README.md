This repo contains the addons and customizations required by the RFA QSL website.

Note that although you can deploy a working instance of the QSL website directly from this code base, it is designed to be used (git cloned) only onto development and build systems.   The actual deployment of the QSL application should be in the form of a docker image onto a platform designed to run docker containers.

Two containers are built from this one single codebase - the 'backend' container and the 'frontend' container.

The database that contains Plone content, which the backend uses, is not stored in this or any repositories and is maintained as a separate database installation. Documentation on database setup is also not maintained here to intentionally create a hard and deliberate distinction between "code and content". and "database implementation".  If this repo is downloaded, built, installed and run, you will not see the same content that is in production until the production database is also copied and configured to run on the same system, and this is entirely by design and intentional.

It is absolutely not recommended to configure any instances of this application to a production database unless you know exactly what you are doing.  Best practice is to always run a separate instance of the content database from production to avoid unintentional writes or corruption of a production database.   You have been warned.

## Quick start

### Development Setup

- Python 3.9
- Node 16
- yarn
- Docker

### Install

```shell
git clone git@github.com:RadioFreeAsia/QSL/qsl.git
cd rfaqsl
make install
```

### Start

Start the Backend (http://localhost:8080/)

```shell
make start-backend
```

Start the Frontend (http://localhost:3000/)

```shell
make start-frontend
```

## Structure

This monorepo is composed by two distinct codebases: api and frontend.

- **backend**: API (Backend) Plone installation using pip (not buildout). Includes a policy package named rfaqsl
- **frontend**: React (Volto) package named frontend

### Reasoning

- Repo contains all codebase needed to run the site (excluding existing addons for Plone and React).
- Github Workflows are triggered based on changes on each codebase (see .github/workflows)
- Easier to create Docker images for each codebase
- Showcase Plone installation/setup without buildout

## Linters and Formatting

There are some hooks to run lint checks on the code. If you want to automatically format them, you can run

`make format`

in the root folder or especifically in each backend or frontend folders.

Linters commands are available in each backend and frontend folder.

## Acceptance tests

There are `Makefile` commands in place:

`build-test-acceptance-server`: Build Acceptance Backend Server Docker image that it's being used afterwards. Must be run before running the tests, if the backend code has changed.

`start-test-acceptance-server`: Start server fixture in docker (previous build required)

`start-test-acceptance-frontend`: Start the Core Acceptance Frontend Fixture in dev mode

`test-acceptance`: Start Core Cypress Acceptance Tests in dev mode
